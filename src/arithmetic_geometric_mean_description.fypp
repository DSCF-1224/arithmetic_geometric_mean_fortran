        !! Safe wrapper for the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) computation 
        !! with input validation and ordering.
        !!
        !! @note
        !! - If either input was NaN: returns NaN
        !! - If `x` and `y` had opposite signs (`x * y .lt. 0`): returns NaN
        !! - If either `x` or `y` is zero (`x * y .eq. 0`): returns 0
        !! - Otherwise: computes AGM using the iterative kernel
