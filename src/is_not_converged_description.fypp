        !! Check if the arithmetic-geometric mean iteration has not yet converged.

        !! **Convergence criterion**  
        !! Returns `.true.` if the absolute difference between the arithmetic mean `a`
        !! and geometric mean `g` exceeds the machine epsilon relative to the smaller value,
        !! as determined by `spacing(min(a, g))`.
        !!
        !! Mathematically: `|a - g| > spacing(min(a, g))`
        !!
        !! **Appendix**  
        !! This function is designed for internal use within the AGM iteration where
        !! both values are guaranteed to be positive and converging.
