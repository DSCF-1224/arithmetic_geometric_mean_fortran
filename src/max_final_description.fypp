        !! Extract the final arithmetic-geometric mean from completed AGM calculations.  
        !! Specifically, this function returns the larger of the two final values.
        !!
        !! @warning
        !! This function assumes the AGM computation has been performed via the `compute` method.  
        !! If called on an uninitialized or improperly computed AGM object,
        !! the result may be NaN or undefined.
